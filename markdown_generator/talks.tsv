Lagrangian Spatio-Temporal Nonstationary Covariance Functions	Talk	talk-2	Joint Statistical Meeting 2020	2020-08-05	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA	http://exampleurl.com	The Lagrangian reference frame has been used to model spatio-temporal dependence of purely spatial second-order stationary random fields that are being transported. This modeling paradigm involves transforming the space-time coordinates to spatial ones. Recently, it has been used to capture dependence in space and time of purely spatial random fields with second-order nonstationarity and its implementation on existing purely spatial nonstationary covariance functions is straightforward. However, the presence of mechanisms enforcing second-order nonstationary behavior introduces considerable challenges in parameter estimation under this class. To address this, we propose to model the second-order nonstationarity parameters by means of thin plate splines. This entails choosing appropriate locations, also called landmarks, at which the basis functions are centered. In addition, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we tackle consequences of model misspecification, that is, we discuss the implications, both in the stationary and nonstationary cases, of fitting spatio-temporal Lagrangian covariance functions on data generated from non-Lagrangian models, and vice versa. Lastly, we apply the Lagrangian models and the new estimation techniques on particulate matter concentrations over Saudi Arabia.
Spatio-Temporal Cross-Covariance Functions under the Lagrangian Framework	Talk	talk-1	Joint Statistical Meeting 2019	2019-07-30	Denver, Colorado, USA	http://exampleurl.com	In most atmospheric data such as pollutants at different levels of the atmosphere, a special property is observed: the covariances and cross-covariances along the direction at which a prevailing weather system travels are stronger than the ones lying in other directions. This resulting dynamics prompts the use of a Lagrangian reference frame wherein we describe the development of a phenomenon in space and in time while moving or traveling with it. Such covariance models have been proposed in the past but only in the univariate setting. We propose and investigate their multivariate extension. A simulation study shows that the parameters of these covariance models can be estimated using weighted least squares and that spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions built under the Lagrangian framework outperform other spatio-temporal cross-covariance models in modeling the aforementioned phenomenon. We demonstrate the modeling approach on a bivariate pollutant dataset of particulate matter in Saudi Arabia. We observe substantial improvements in forecast accuracy.
