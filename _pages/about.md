Hi! I'm Mary Lai, a Filipino :philippines: statistician based in Houston, Texas. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Mathematics, University of Houston. Prior to joining University of Houston in 2021, I was a PhD student in the Spatio-Temporal Statistics group at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia.

Work and Research
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Educational Background
------
I received my BS and MS degrees in applied mathematics from Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines, in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and my Ph.D. in Statistics from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. 

Research Interests
------
My research interests include multivariate spatio-temporal statistics and high-performance computing for large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets.
