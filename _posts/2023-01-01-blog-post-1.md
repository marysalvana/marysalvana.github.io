Download spatial dataset from this link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/162DlIuJjLcx8-md34ywfll47wk0ucA4G/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Argo dataset</a>. An RData file called `jan_march_residuals.RData` will be downloaded and typically saved in the Downloads folder and can be moved to another directory for the subsequent spatial data analysis.

Spatial data analysis is performed on the RStudio console. A step-by-step procedure is given below with the corresponding screen outputs.

1. **Open RStudio.**

{:start="2"}
2. **Load spatial dataset.** To load the dataset, locate the directory where the Argo dataset file is stored and save the location in a variable called `data_directory`:

```{c}
data_directory <- 'replace_with_the_directory_where_Argo_dataset_is_stored' 
##for example: data_directory <- '/Users/laisalvana/Downloads/'

#Load the spatial dataset into the R session using the following: R function load(), data_directory, and file name of the spatial dataset

load(paste(data_directory, 'jan_march_residuals.RData', sep = ''))
```

{:start="3"}
3. **Get familiar with the information contained inside the spatial dataset `jan_march_residuals.RData`.**
