Download spatial dataset from this link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/162DlIuJjLcx8-md34ywfll47wk0ucA4G/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Argo dataset</a>. An RData file called `jan_march_residuals.RData` will be downloaded and typically saved in the Downloads folder and can be moved to another directory for the subsequent spatial data analysis.

Spatial data analysis is performed on the RStudio console. A step-by-step procedure is given below with the corresponding screen outputs.

1. **Open RStudio.**

2. **Load spatial dataset.**

3. **Get familiar with the spatial dataset.** The 5 most relevant data in the Argo dataset are `profPresAggr`,`profPsalAggr`, `profTempAggr`, `profLatAggr`, and `profLongAggr`. 
 * `profPresAggr` is a list with 243,352 elements. Each element represents the pressure measurements recorded by one Argo float as it ascends from 2000 meters back to the surface. 
 * `profPsalAggr` is a list with 243,352 elements. Each element represents the salinity measurements recorded by one Argo float as it ascends from 2000 meters back to the surface. 
 * `profTempAggr` is a list with 243,352 elements. Each element represents the temperature measurements recorded by one Argo float as it ascends from 2000 meters back to the surface.
 * `profLatAggr` is a vector with 243,352 elements. Each element represents the position of the Argo float in latitude when it made the recording.
 * `profLongAggr` is a vector with 243,352 elements. Each element represents the position of the Argo float in longitude when it made the recording.

4. **Data Visualization.** Depending on what you want to see from the data, you can produce different types of plots. 

* Plotting the locations where Argo floats were deployed:

* Plotting the temperature and salinity measurements recorded by Argo float #100000:

* Plotting the heatmap of temperature measurements closest to the surface:
