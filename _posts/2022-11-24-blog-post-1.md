With <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/stephen-curry-exits-warriors-pacers-game-shoulder-injury" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Steph Curry out for a few weeks after getting a shoulder injury</a> and Klay Thompson refusing to play like the Klay Thompson that we know, down goes the hope of the Golden State Warriors to even make the play-in tournament, the chance given to the 7th through 10th seeds in both the Eastern and Western conferences to cling to an NBA playoff spot. Without Steph Curry, the Warriors do not look anything like the team that won the NBA 2022 finals. Sure, it is physically and mentally tough (impossible even!) to fill the shoes of the greatest shooter that ever lived. But nobody is asking them to do that. Not even their head coach, Steve Kerr, expects any one of them to become Steph Curry. What we (I and many other NBA viewers who spend $100 on monthly subscriptions to NBA League Pass and cable TV) want is for them to give us great basketball games to watch and not get beaten by more than 20 points once or twice a week. Just please give us our money's worth! Right now, the Warriors look very scared to play because they do not have Steph, at least for a few weeks, saving their asses off come crunch time. The players are so bad, it makes Steve Kerr's coaching look bad. I have seen more thrilling college basketball games than Warriors games this season. But with their superstar gone, this should be the chance for every superstar wannabee whose butt has never left the bench since they changed their employment status with the IRS to "NBA Athlete" to be somebody that the Golden State Warriors can design their plays on and earn the love and adoration of the team owners.

I know I have not played any professional basketball games or even self-invited myself to the pickup games my younger brother and his friends organize every Saturday morning, but if my self worth depends on me shooting over 7'2" dudes on televised games and have ESPN announcers scream my name everytime I attempt a shot, I am definitely seizing this moment that Steph Curry is on the sidelines. I will impress my coaches at practice so I can get them to let me play on court so I can impress them even more.

The wind was so strong that it blew Kenya's slogan to <a href="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA)" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Beyonce</a>'s airspace, inspiring her to describe her own Super Bowl performance as such.

Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.
