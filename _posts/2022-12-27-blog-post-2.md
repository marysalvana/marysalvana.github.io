To develop the package, we use the R package called `devtools` to facilitate. 

To start the development of the new R package, we attach the `devtools` package and call the `create_package()` function that initializes the components of the package.

```
library(devtools)
usethis::create_package("/Users/laisalvana/DiffOp")
```

This creates the following files:
* Folder R
* `DESCRIPTION`
* `NAMESPACE`
* `DiffOp.Rproj`
* `.Rbuildignore` lists files that should not be included when building the R package
* `.gitignore` list files that Git should ignore such as some files created by R and RStudio
