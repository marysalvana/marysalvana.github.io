Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.

<table width=1000 style="border:none; border-collapse:collapse; cellspacing:0; cellpadding:0" >
        <tr>
            <td style="border:none" rowspan=2>
                <img src="/images/sonja_morgan.gif" />
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
