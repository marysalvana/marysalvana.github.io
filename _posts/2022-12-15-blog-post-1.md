Curry-less Warriors
======

With <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/stephen-curry-exits-warriors-pacers-game-shoulder-injury" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Steph Curry out for a few weeks after getting a shoulder injury</a> and Klay Thompson refusing to play like the Klay Thompson that we know, down goes the hope of the Golden State Warriors to even make the play-in tournament, the chance given to the 7th through 10th seeds in both the Eastern and Western conferences to cling to an NBA playoff spot. Let's be honest. The general consensus is that the championship rings that Golden State has under Steve Kerr has a lot to do with Steph Curry's godlike shooting skills. Now with their leader recupertating on the sidelines, the individual greatness of the members of the Golden State Warriors is being questioned and their ability to play great basketball without Steph is being challenged. After watching them lose to the New York Knicks by 38 points, I have to say that the critics may be right. 

In basketball lingo, players who were the most vital in winning the champhionship, like Steph Curry, are called bus drivers, and the rest, bus riders. Although I prefer a yacht captain and a yacht crew analogy because at least these terms suggest that everybody has a special role to play in getting the yacht to sail, much like a basketball team, but bus drivers and bus riders can do the job (maybe?). These terms are to some extent offensive that it hurt Kevin Durant's ego   

Were they actually just hitching on Steph's greatness?

Will of the Wind

Whether Sonja understood how transport effect works or not, is something we should not bother thinking about.

Propelled her to stardom which she claims she had in the first place. The wind was so strong that it blew Kenya's slogan to <a href="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA)" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Beyonce</a>'s airspace, inspiring her to describe her own Super Bowl performance as such.

While I may not be in the business of organizing dog funeral events along the East River in New York and I am not in Hollywood crafting taglines that people can stick on memes and gifs, I get paid to model and forecast climate events and weather patterns. 

Us statisticians like to describe anything and everything (whose values fluctuate) with distributions.

Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.

Aren't headings cool?
