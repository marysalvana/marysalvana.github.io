Curry-less Warriors
======

With <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/stephen-curry-exits-warriors-pacers-game-shoulder-injury" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Steph Curry out for a few weeks after getting a shoulder injury</a> and Klay Thompson refusing to play like the Klay Thompson that we know, down goes the chances of the Golden State Warriors (GSW) to even make the play-in tournament, the opportunity given to the 7th through 10th seeds in both the Eastern and Western conferences to cling to an NBA playoff spot. The whispers are that GSW is nothing without Steph and that the championships they won have a lot to do with Steph's godlike shooting. Now that Steph is recuperating on the sidelines, the individual greatness of the members of the Warriors team is being questioned and their ability to play great basketball without Steph is being challenged. After watching them lose to the New York Knicks by 38 points and to the Brooklyn Nets by 30 points the next day, I have to say that the rumors maybe right. 

In basketball lingo, players who proved to be the most vital piece in winning the champhionship, like Steph Curry, are called bus drivers, and the rest of the team, bus riders. The idea that a team's success can be attributed to one person who was deemed to have carried the team is somehow insulting to the other members who clearly put in the work. The bus driver and bus rider classification is offensive that it hurt <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/04/26/kevin-durant-responds-charles-barkley-recent-criticism-bus-rider" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Kevin Durant</a>'s feelings. The former league MVP, who won two championships as a part of the Warriors team, refused to be branded as someone who hitched on Steph to get his championship rings. I see why Durant and other players may take offense. Bus riders do nothing. They ride the bus and let the driver take them to their desired destination. Which is why I propose the yacht captain and yacht crew as a replacement to this analogy. My proposed terms suggest that everyone is working to get the yacht to sail, much like a basketball team. In the game of basketball, especially in NBA, reputation is everything. While it is a team sport, the players are evaluated individually. 

While nobody in the NBA wants to be called a bus rider, the concept of bus driving and bus riding is an important phenomenon in Physics.

Whether Sonja understood how transport effect works or not, is something we should not bother thinking about.

Propelled her to stardom which she claims she had in the first place. The wind was so strong that it blew Kenya's slogan to <a href="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA)" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Beyonce</a>'s airspace, inspiring her to describe her own Super Bowl performance as such.

While I may not be in the business of organizing dog funeral events along the East River in New York and I am not in Hollywood crafting taglines that people can stick on memes and gifs, I get paid to model and forecast climate events and weather patterns. 

Us statisticians like to describe anything and everything (whose values fluctuate) with distributions.

Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.

Aren't headings cool?
