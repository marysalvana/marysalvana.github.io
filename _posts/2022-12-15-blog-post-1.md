Curry-less Warriors
======
With <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/stephen-curry-exits-warriors-pacers-game-shoulder-injury" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Steph Curry out for a few weeks after getting a shoulder injury</a> and Klay Thompson refusing to play like the Klay Thompson that we know, down goes the hope of the Golden State Warriors to even make the play-in tournament, a chance given to the 7th through 10th seeds in each conference to cling to an NBA playoff spot. Without Steph Curry, the Warriors do not look anything like the team that won the NBA 2022 finals. Must be mentally hard to fill the shoes of the greatest shooter that ever lived. But we never ask any member of the Warriors team to be Steph Curry. We just want them to give us great basketball games to watch and not get beaten by the XXth seed Pistons. I am begging them to make my $100 monthly subscriptions to NBA League Pass and Youtube TV worth it. They have to figure out new plays, new rotations, and without depending on Steph. They need to figure it out fast because Christmas Day games is fast approaching and I am not sure if there is anything fun to watch.

Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.

Aren't headings cool?
