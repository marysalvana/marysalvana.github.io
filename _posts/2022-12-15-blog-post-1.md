Curry-less Warriors
======

With <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/stephen-curry-exits-warriors-pacers-game-shoulder-injury" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Steph Curry out for a few weeks after getting a shoulder injury</a> and Klay Thompson refusing to play like the Klay Thompson that we know, down goes the hope of the Golden State Warriors to even make the play-in tournament, the chance given to the 7th through 10th seeds in both the Eastern and Western conferences to cling to an NBA playoff spot. Without Steph Curry, the Warriors do not look anything like the team that won the NBA 2022 finals. It is definitely physically and mentally tough to fill the shoes of the greatest shooter that ever lived. But nobody is asking them to do that. Not even their head coach, Steve Kerr, expects any one of them to become Steph Curry. We just want them to give us great basketball games to watch and not get beaten by more than 20 points once or twice a week. I am begging them to make my $100 monthly subscriptions to NBA League Pass and Youtube TV worth it. Steve Kerr cannot seem to figure out how to draw new plays and new rotations without depending on Steph. Easy to say because I am not in the highly pressurized industry, that is, the NBA, and my career does not depend on me impressing my coaches at practice so they will use me on the court come gametime, giving me another chance at impressing them even more. With 7'2" dudes hounding my every attempt at shooting the ball. But with their superstar gone, this is the chance for each of those reserves who have been warming the bench since they got drafted by the team to get in the court and be somebody that the Golden State Warriors can design their plays on.

The wind was so strong that it blew Kenya's slogan to <a href="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxu4K2mC4uA)" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >Beyonce</a>'s airspace, inspiring her to describe her own Super Bowl performance as such.

Friendly advice from a space-time statistician: remember to make the wind work for you, not against you.

Aren't headings cool?
