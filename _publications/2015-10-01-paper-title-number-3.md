permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'The Lagrangian reference frame has been used to model spatio-temporal
dependence of purely spatial second-order stationary random fields that are being
transported. This modeling paradigm involves transforming a purely spatial process
to spatio-temporal by introducing a transformation in the spatial coordinates.
Recently, it has been used to capture dependence in space and time of transported
purely spatial random fields with second-order nonstationarity. However, under this
modeling framework, the presence of mechanisms enforcing second-order nonstationary
behavior introduces considerable challenges in parameter estimation. To
address these, we propose a new estimation methodology which includes modeling
the second-order nonstationarity parameters by means of thin plate splines and estimating
all the parameters via two-step maximum likelihood estimation. In addition,
through numerical experiments, we tackle the consequences of model misspecification.
That is, we discuss the implications, both in the stationary and nonstationary
cases, of fitting Lagrangian spatio-temporal covariance functions to data generated
from non-Lagrangian models, and vice versa. Lastly, we apply the Lagrangian models
and the new estimation technique to analyze particulate matter concentrations
over Saudi Arabia.'
