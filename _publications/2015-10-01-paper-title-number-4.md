excerpt: 'When analyzing the spatio-temporal dependence in most environmental and earth sciences
variables such as pollutant concentrations at different levels of the atmosphere, a special property
is observed: the covariances and cross-covariances are stronger in certain directions. This
property is attributed to the presence of natural forces, such as wind, which cause the transport
and dispersion of these variables. This spatio-temporal dynamics prompts the integration of the
Lagrangian reference frame to any Gaussian spatio-temporal geostatistical model. Under this
modeling framework, a whole new class was birthed and is known as the class of spatio-temporal
covariance functions under the Lagrangian framework, with several developments already established
in the univariate setting, in both stationary and nonstationary formulations, but less so in
the multivariate case. Despite the many advances in this modeling approach, efforts have yet to
be directed to probing the case for the use of multiple advections, especially when several variables
are involved. Accounting for multiple advections makes the Lagrangian framework a more
viable approach in modeling realistic multivariate transport scenarios. In this work, we establish
a class of Lagrangian spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions with multiple advections, study
its properties, and demonstrate its use on a bivariate pollutant dataset of particulate matter in
Saudi Arabia.'
