excerpt: 'In multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, we are faced with the
formidable challenge of specifying a valid spatio-temporal crosscovariance
function, either directly or through the construction
of processes. This task is difficult as these functions should
yield positive definite covariance matrices. In recent years, we
have seen a flourishing of methods and theories on constructing
spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions satisfying the positive
definiteness requirement. A subset of those techniques
produced spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions possessing
the additional feature of nonstationarity. Here we provide a
review of the state-of-the-art methods and technical progress regarding
model construction. In addition, we introduce a rich class
of multivariate spatio-temporal asymmetric nonstationary models
stemming from the Lagrangian framework. We demonstrate
the capabilities of the proposed models on a bivariate reanalysis
climate model output dataset previously analyzed using purely
spatial models. Furthermore, we carry out a cross-validation
study to examine the advantages of using spatio-temporal models
over purely spatial models. Finally, we outline future research
directions and open problems.'
